# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter Trends

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
I worked with data from a kickstarter campaign to analyze the data and find the timeframes where the campaigns will be more successful.  The charts and graphs will help Louise to better plan in the future.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I used excel to perform the analysis, including the use of pivot tables and charts to represent the data in multiple ways to make it easier to interpret.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I used formulas in excel to help me narrow down the overall data set to view specific details regarding how many capaigns were successful for a specific category.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I found it tedious to adjust my formulas to reference the appropriate cells.  I later remembered there is a lock cell feature in Excel where a "$" symbol will freeze a certain refernce as you copy the formula foward.  Once I realized this the adjustments that I needed to make to my formulas was minimal.

## Results

-  Based on the analysis of the data we conclude that campaigns reach a peak of success in May and June, the success rate decreases the remainder of the year.  We should continue to launch the most campaigns in the months of May and June.

- We can conclude the success and fail rates are direct opposites of one another.  The most successful campaigns are with a goal less than $1,000.

- Some limittations include any outliers that many exist within the data set as well as any inconcistencies with the collected data.

- We can create a table and or graph to represent which categories are most successful.  We can also create a table and graph to see which capaigns have the most backers to understand if there are any commonalities amoung those campaigns.
